      <p>
        I am currently a Technical Writer for Critical Path Services. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        When I was a Quality Assurance Auditor for Critical Path Services I was responsible for report audits and in-phase lab audits for several different labs such as Environmental Fate, Residue and Product Chemistry. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My first job post undergrad was a Senior Laboratory Technician in the Environmental Fate Department at Bayer CropScience. I started as a laboratory technician with basic support roles/laboratory maintenance in August of 2013. Within a year I took on a more significant role in the conduct of environmental fate studies where I assisted several study directors with multiple aerobic and anaerobic soil metabolism studies. I was also responsible for overseeing junior laboratory technicians and training new staff. I also gained experience in the residue chemistry laboratory, running extractions on my own using LIMS and several LC/MS. 
      </p>  
      <p>
        As for my personality, I have a passion for learning, helping people, participating in research and a love for science, technology, art, the environment and animals.
